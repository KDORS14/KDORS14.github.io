By the time I am writing this data science blog, it will be just one month before the summer of 2019. It only occurred to me that the Data Science field existed just about a year ago. As a graduate student with an electrical engineering degree, I dived into an IT job right after graduation. At first, my role was not very technical; I had worked mostly as a business and QA analyst for three years. I mostly worked on collecting and understand business requirements and eventually testing these requirements to ensure that they were matching to what the client had expected. Most of the testing that I had performed was through clicking various sections of a User Interface.  As I moved along in my career, I got to analyze a lot of data and had to use SQL queries and sometimes pivot tables in excel. I realized that I enjoyed gathering and cleaning big data sets which would be later reconstructed in a presentable format to the client. 


Now that my passion for analytics had risen, I was looking to enhance my career along the data analyst/analytics route. It was while performing this research that I came along Data Science and read that it was a role that was in high demand. Most job descriptions for a data scientist were very intriguing to me. For example, data mining, machine learning and predictive analysis were aspects that not only allowed better ways to analyze and cleanse data but there were opportunities to learn coding as well such as Python and R programming. 

I have now started my journey as a data scientist by enlisting in a bootcamp that will teach the best and up-to-date methods being used in the field today. My goal is to be able to utilize the data science skills that I have learned to land a data scientist role in early 2020.
